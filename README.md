## Gist Playground

Take a gist and create a simple playground for it.

Takes the first of each type of file in a gist: `.html`, `.css`, `.js`

Runs all of the code inside an iframe and sends `console.log()` to the parent using [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage)
